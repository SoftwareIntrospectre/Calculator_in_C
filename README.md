Learning C by building progressively more complex projects. This one is simple: build a command-line calculator.

Each version is more refined, and is meant to show my thought process of what can be improved.

calculator_v1.c = the most basic functionality
calculator_v2.c = Uses a switch statement to calculate dynamically in the main() function
calculator_v3.c = take in user input and apply it to the previous version
calculator_v4.c = Using pointers, memory addresses, and memory management (malloc() and free()) to get used to it. Builds on v3.
